	If they guess the number, alert this fact and tell them how many guesses it took them to guess the number.
	
	Generate a random number
	Promt the user to enter a guess choosing a number 1-10
	If it is higher or lower than the random number alert the user
	If user does not guess correct alert user to guess again
	If the user guess is correct alert the user they are correct and alert user how many guesses it took them and that they won the game.
