<p> Yuto Horigome was born January 7th, 1999 in the famous city of Tokyo, Japan. 
Yuto was born in a family of 5 with two younger brothers. 
He started his career of skateboarding at the young age of 7, picking up after his father who was a former street skateboarder. 
He started skating at his local skatepark Tokyo's Amazing Square Murasaki Skatepark. 
After a couple of years of skating, his skating career began to get serious and at the age of 14, he started traveling to America for better skating opportunities.
He now currently competes in many notorious skate competitions and is recognized as one of the best street skaters in the world.
Yuto currently resides in Los Angeles, where he continues to skate. 
He is finally starting to get the recognition he deserves after his recent gold-medal finish at the 2020 Olympics that took place in his hometown, Tokyo Japan.


<p> I chose Yuto as my hero, because skateboarding is one of my hobbies that I have done my whole life, and I look up to someone who is so good at the sport such as Yuto. 
Currently he is ranked as the 2nd best street skater in the world and recently winning the gold medal in the 2020 Summer olympics he has posed a hero for so many kids. 
Yuto is also my hero because I skate a lot of his signature skateboards made by the brand April that he is sponsored by. April skateboards is a company run by another famous skater 
Shane Oneil, and I've grown to like both <a href="https://ebiographypost.com/sports/skateboarders/yuto-horigome-biography-net-worth-sponsors-career-deck-family-parents-girlfriend">Yuto Horigome <a/> and Shane Oneil because they are both really down to Earth and inspiring to other young skaters.
